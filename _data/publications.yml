    Diese Arbeit befasst sich mit der Erstellung von Bleistiftzeichnungen dreidimensionaler Modelle in Echtzeit und prüft die Anwendbarkeit auf virtuelle 3D-Stadtmodelle. 
    Bisherige Verfahren gehen kaum auf stilprägende subjektive Einflüsse der Zeichner ein. 
    So werden stilrelevante Maßnahmen wie weiche Schatten und Lichteinflüsse durch Umgebungsverdeckung häufig vernachlässigt. 
    Nach einer kurzen Zusammenfassung bisheriger Ansätze zur Nachahmung von Bleistiftzeichnungen, werden effiziente Implementierung für Konturdarstellung und Krümmungsapproximation zur Schraffur vorgestellt. 
    Da die meisten Berechnungen diskretisiert im Bildraum vorgenommen werden, entstehen beim Rendern komplexer 3D-Stadtmodelle störende, mit der Tiefe zunehmende Artefakte. 
    Zur Abschwächung dieser Störfaktoren werden praktische Lösungen wie stilkonforme Tiefenfokussierung diskutiert.

  abstract:
    The document was written and is available in German language only (sorry).
    <br><br>
    In this work we present a system for image-synthesis of atmospheric effects in virtual 3d environments.
    It allows realtime rendering of dynamic, high quality environments for background composition (background scenery) for a variety of applications not only in video-games and simulators
    (e.g., Flight- or vehicle-simulators), but also for architectural and historical visualizations.
    To ensure ease of integration, only the background associated phenomena are taken into account. 
    Thereby a texture-based, and a simulation-based approach are presented. 
    The texture-based approach targets the imitation of any environment and uses wellknown, texture-based methods with hardly any creative limitations. 
    They are expandable and ideal for applications where, in resprect to the rendering performance, only low capacities can be allocated.
    The simulation-based, astrophysical approach, in contrast, is based on astronomical algorithms and astrophysical observations.
    The new models and methods used within this approach, provide the conceptual focus of this work. 
    Both approaches are optimized for rendering dynamic day-night cycles within a single rendering pass and without subsequent processing. 
    They are integrated in a large representative rendering system (OpenSceneGraph). 
    Detailed performance measurements in different scenarios and quality levels show that the system has little effect on overall rendering-speed.

  abstract:
    This paper presents techniques for astronomical based, real-time rendering of skies as seen from low altitudes on earth, in respect to location, date, and time. 
    The techniques allow for composing an atmosphere with sun, multiple cloud layers, moon, bright stars, and Milky Way, into a holistic sky with unprecedented level of detail and diversity. 
    GPU generated, viewpoint-aligned billboards are used to render stars with approximated color, brightness, and scintillations. 
    A similar approach is used to synthesize the moon considering lunar phase, earthshine, shading, and lunar eclipses.

  abstract:
    Software maps&mdash;linking 2.5D treemaps, software system structure, and performance indicators&mdash;are commonly used to support informed decision making in software-engineering processes. 
    In this paper a web-based rendering system for software maps that achieves both fast client-side page load time and interactive frame rates even with large software maps is presented. 
    The page load time is significantly reduced by efficiently encoding hierarchy and geometry data for the net transport.

  published: ACM/EG Expressive Posters
  abstract:
    This work presents a photo-editing method that enables per-pixel parameter manipulation of image filtering by means of interactive painting.
    Predefined or custom image filters are exposed to the user, as a parametrizable composition of image operations. 
    Brushes, as sequences of actions mapping user inputs (in terms of brush shape, flow, pressure, etc.) to arbitrary functions or convolution operators, are used to draw within the parameter space. 
    It demonstrates how interactive painting can be used to, e.g., locally tweak parametrization and, furthermore, provides a blueprint for an collaborative photo-editing platform.

  abstract:
    This paper presents an approach for transforming images into an oil paint look.
    A color quantization scheme is proposed that performs feature-aware recolorization using the dominant colors of the input image. 
    In addition, an approach for real-time computation of paint textures is presented that builds on the smoothed structure adapted to the main feature contours of the quantized image. 
    The stylization technique leads to homogeneous outputs in the color domain and enables creative control over the visual output, such as color adjustments and per-pixel parametrizations by means of interactive painting.

    Therefore, Unreal Engine 4 is prototypically used to render Software maps and natural phenomena, such as fire, clouds, smoke, rain, rust, or shininess in real-time. 
    Trend data is automatically computed by hierarchically accumulating as well as analyzing the underlying software metrics, and is mapped to the additional visual variables.

  abstract:
    An interactive system for transforming images into an oil paint look is presented.
    First, dominant colors from an input image are derived for feature-aware recolorization and quantization to conform with a global color palette. 
    Afterwards, it employs non-linear filtering based on the smoothed structure adapted to the main feature contours of the quantized image to synthesize a paint texture in real-time.
    Furthermore, a generalized brush-based painting interface is introduced that operates within parameter spaces to locally adjust the level of abstraction of the filtering effects.

  abstract:
    Treemaps serve as generic, effective tools to display, explore, and analyze multi-variate tree data in a scalable, interactive, and consistent way
    In this paper, we discuss and evaluate sketchiness as visual variable of 2.5D treemaps. 
    Sketchy rendering techniques allow us to map data, e.g., about uncertainty, imprecision, or vagueness, independently from mappings to other visual variables such as size, color, and height. 
    To this end, we present a design space for sketchy rendering for 2.5D treemaps and corresponding implementation of a real-time sketchy rendering technique.
    The results of three user studies carried out indicate that sketchiness is a promising candidate for an independent visual variable for 2.5D treemaps, in particular to map ordinal data with a small range such as data that qualifies map items, it shows no strong interference with other visual variables such as color and height due to the regular gestalt of blocks and, hence, allows us to extend the expressiveness of 2.5D treemaps.

  published: ACM SIGGRAPH Posters
  abstract:
    In a rendering environment of comparatively sparse interaction, e.g., digital production tools, image synthesis and its quality do not have to be constrained to single frames.
    This work analyzes strategies for highly economically rendering of state-of-the-art rendering effects using progressive multi-frame sampling in real-time.
    By distributing and accumulating samples of sampling-based rendering techniques (e.g., anti-aliasing, orderindependent transparency, depth-of-field and shadowing, ambient occlusion, screen-space reflections) over multiple frames, images of very high quality can be synthesized with unequaled resource-efficiency.

  published: Proc. ACM International Conference on Web3D Technology (Web3D)
  abstract:
    The 2.5D treemap represents a general purpose visualization technique to map multi-variate hierarchical data in a scalable, interactive, and consistent way used in a number of application fields.
    In this paper, we explore the capabilities of Declarative 3D for the web-based implementation of 2.5D treemap clients.
    Particularly, we investigate how X3DOM and XML3D can be used to implement clients with equivalent features that interactively display 2.5D treemaps with dynamic mapping of attributes.
    We also show a first step towards a glTF-based implementation. These approaches are benchmarked focusing on their interaction capabilities with respect to rendering and speed of dynamic data mapping.
    We discuss the results for our representative example of a complex 3D interactive visualization technique and summerize recommendations for improvements towards operational web clients.

  published: Proc. International Conference on Information Visualization Theory and Applications (IVAPP)
  abstract: 
    Depicting massive software system data using treemaps can result in visual clutter and increased cognitive load.
    This paper introduces an adaptive level-of-detail (LoD) technique that uses scoring for interactive aggregation on a per-node basis.
    The scoring approximates importance by degree-of-interest measures as well as screen and user-interaction scores.
    The technique adheres to established aggregation guidelines and was evaluated by means of two user studies.
    The first investigates task completion time in visual search.
    The second evaluates the readability of the presented nesting level contouring for aggregates.
    With the adaptive LoD technique software maps allow for multi-resolution depictions of software system information while facilitating annotation and efficient identification of important nodes.

    Information cartography services provided via web-based clients using real-time rendering do not always necessitate a continuous stream of updates in the visual display.
    This paper shows how progressive rendering by means of multi-frame sampling and frame accumulation can introduce high-quality visual effects using robust and straightforward implementations.
    For it, (1) a suitable rendering loop is described, (2) WebGL limitations are discussed, and (3) an adaption of THREE.js featuring progressive anti-aliasing, screen-space ambient occlusion, and depth of field is detailed.
    Furthermore, sampling strategies are discussed and rendering performance is evaluated, emphasizing the low per-frame costs of this approach.

    It enables a new form of overview+detail visualization for tree-structured data and contributes new concepts for real-time rendering of and interaction with treemaps.
    The technique operates by tilting the graphical elements representing inner nodes using affine transformations and animated state transitions.
    We explain how to mix orthogonal and perspective projections within a single treemap.
    Finally, we show application examples that benefit from the reduced interaction overhead.

  title: Interactive, Adaptive Level-of-Detail in 2.5D Treemaps
  date: '2018-07-10'
  authors: 
  - Daniel Limberger
  published: United States Patent and Trademark Office
  abstract:
      An aggregation approach allows for a dynamic, interactive, adaptive level-of-detail for 2D, 2.5D, and 3D treemaps for visualization of complex information. 
      For example, the 2.5D treemap visualization concept is extended by providing adaptive identification of aggregates by means of an interactive node scoring approach based on contextual relevance and various other task, interaction, visibility, and/or performance specific criteria. 
      For the resulting mapping and rendering, a per-frame aggregation of blocks and accumulation of those attributes mapped to visual variables (context) is described. 
      Since every embodiment is also targeted for dynamic, interactive visual display of 2.5D treemaps, the rendering is designed to be capable for execution in real-time.
      Visual preservation of important information is conveyed by hierarchy elements and their mapped attributes (nodes-of-interest) as well as compliance to known aggregation guidelines including visualization of aggregated color and height information, visualization of aggregates that are discernible from non-aggregates, and visualization of outliers within aggregates. 
      Applications include visualization of software maps, business intelligence data, file hierarchies for storage devices, and the like.

  abstract:
      Today's rendering APIs lack robust functionality and capabilities for dynamic, real-time text rendering and labeling, which represent key requirements for 3D application design in many fields.
      As a consequence, most rendering systems are barely or not at all equipped with respective capabilities.
      This paper drafts the unified text rendering and labeling API OpenLL intended to complement common rendering APIs, frameworks, and transmission formats.
      For it, various uses of static and dynamic placement of labels are showcased and a text interaction technique is presented.
      Furthermore, API design constraints with respect to state-of-the-art text rendering techniques are discussed.
      This contribution is intended to initiate a community-driven specification of a free and open label library.

  published: Proc. ACM International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction (VINCI)
  abstract:
      The 2.5D treemap facilitates interactive exploration of multivariate data. 
      It includes height as a visual variable for additional information display and enables exploration of correlations within mapped attributes. 
      In this paper techniques for the visual display of a height reference for interactive modification from within the visualization are introduced.
      Results of a preliminary user study are presented and potential benefits for improved performance, i.e., precision and speed, of identification, comparison, filtering, and selection tasks are discussed.

  title: In-Situ Comparison for 2.5D Treemaps

  published: Proc. International Conference on Information Visualization Theory and Applications (IVAPP)
  abstract:
      2.5D treemaps can be used to visualize tree-structured data using the height dimension for additional information display. 
      For tree-structured and time-variant data though, changes or variants in the data are difficult to visualize. 
      This paper presents an in-situ approach to depict differences between two versions (original and comparative state) of a data set, e.g., metrics of different revisions of a software system, in a single 2.5D treemap.
      Multiple geometry variants for the in-situ representation of individual nodes, especially concerning height, area, and color, are presented and discussed. 
      Finally, a preliminary study for the simultaneous change of attributes in height and area is described, hinting that arrow pattern help to clarify reading direction.

  abstract:
      Software maps provide a general-purpose interactive user interface and information display for software analytics tools.
      This paper systematically introduces and classifies software maps as a treemap-based technique for software cartography.
      It provides an overview of advanced visual metaphors and techniques, each suitable for interactive visual analytics tasks, that can be used to enhance the expressiveness of software maps.
      Thereto, the metaphors and techniques are briefly described, located within a visualization pipeline model, and considered within the software map design space.
      Consequent applications and use cases w.r.t. different types of software system data and software engineering data are discussed, arguing for a versatile use of software maps in visual software analytics.

  abstract: 
      This article reiterates on the recently presented hierarchy visualization service HiViSer and its API.
      It illustrates its decomposition into modular services for data processing and visualization of tree-structured data.
      The decomposition is aligned to the common structure of visualization pipelines and, in this way, facilitates attribution of the services' capabilities.
      Suitable base resource types are proposed and their structure and relations as well as a subtyping concept for specifics in hierarchy visualization implementations are detailed. Moreover, state-of-the-art quality standards and techniques for self-documentation and discovery of components are incorporated.
      As a result, a blueprint for Web service design, architecture, modularization, and composition is presented, targeting fundamental visualization tasks of tree-structured data, i.e., gathering, processing, rendering, and provisioning. Finally, the applicability of the service components and the API is evaluated in the context of exemplary applications.

  title: A Taxonomy of Treemap Visualization Techniques

  abstract: 
    A treemap is a visualization that has been specifically designed to facilitate the exploration of tree-structured data and, more general, hierarchically structured data. 
    The family of visualization techniques that use a visual metaphor for parent-child relationships based "on the property of containment" (Johnson, 1993) is commonly referred to as treemaps. 
    However, as the number of variations of treemaps grows, it becomes increasingly important to distinguish clearly between techniques and their specific characteristics. 
    This paper proposes to discern between Space-filling Treemap, Containment Treemap, Implicit Edge Representation Tree, and Mapped Tree for classification of hierarchy visualization techniques and highlights their respective properties.
    This taxonomy is created as a hyponymy, i.e., its classes have an is-a relationship to one another. 
    With this proposal, we intend to stimulate a discussion on a more unambiguous classification of treemaps and, furthermore, broaden what is understood by the concept of treemap itself.

  authors:

  published: Proc. ACM International Conference on Web3D Technology (Web3D)
  abstract:
    This paper presents a progressive rendering approach that enables rendering of static 3D scenes, lit by physically-based environment and area lights.
    Multi-frame sampling strategies are used to approximate elaborate lighting that is refined while showing intermediate results to the user.
    The presented approach enables interactive yet high-quality rendering in the web and runs on a wide range of devices including low-performance hardware such as mobile devices.
    An open-source implementation of the described techniques using TypeScript and WebGL 2.0 is presented and provided.
    For evaluation, we compare our rendering results to both a path tracer and a physically-based rasterizer.
    Our findings show that the approach approximates the lighting and shadowing of the path-traced reference well while being faster than the compared rasterizer.

    This paper presents a rendering framework for the visualization of massive point datasets in the web.
    It includes highly interactive point rendering, cluster visualization, basic interaction methods, and importance-based labeling, while being available for both mobile and desktop browsers.
    The rendering style is customizable, as shown in figure 1.
    Our evaluation indicates that the framework facilitates interactive visualization of tens of millions of raw data points even without dynamic filtering or aggregation.
